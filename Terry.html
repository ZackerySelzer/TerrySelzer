of cross border real estate acquisitions by:

• assisting in the development of the investment strategy and exit plan;
 
• advising on the selection of investment property; 
 
• reviewing architectural plans of proposed and existing buildings;

The second primary service is building bridges between parties from different countries to help them solve problems that arise in the negotiation or implementation of cross border agreements by: 

• quickly getting an understanding of the overall situation,

   their problems.
